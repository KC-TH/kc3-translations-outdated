        "4": "Even though I said tenacity is my strong point.... this is going too far\u00a0! Admiral, I'm going to get angry\u00a0!",
        "29": "Eh? Pola? She still carries a bottle of booze? That's sounds typically bad. Admiral, where did you saw her? I need to look for her...",
        "28": "Admiral, how are you? Good, I'm relieved! Of course, I'm worried about Pola too, but right now it's just us two, right? Hehe... Oh! I didn't mean it in that way, but...",
        "24": "Admiral, what's the matter? This is... eh? A ring? Admiral, you want to remember me even more? I see... It seems my tenacity hits you as well, is it? Hehe... Grazie, Admiral.",

        "10": "Torpedo tubes...? No, I don't need it. It's not needed for me. But I don't mind equipping it. Is this really an oxygen torpedo? Yes! Grazie, Admiral!",
        "26": "It's tenacity or nothing!",
        "27": "Admiral, thank you!",
        "11": "They got me. Sorry. I'm going to the shower. Just a moment, I'll be done in a moment.",
        "12": "Sheesh... my clothes and equipment is in shambles! I still lack toughness! But next time I will succeed!",
        "5": "Admiral, A new ship has been constructed.",
        "7": "Admiral, operazione complete!",
        "14": "Pola, you okay? No booze for you today. Zara's fleet, moving out! Follow my lead!",
        "15": "Enemy ships spotted, ready for shelling! Now, let's begin us Zara's battle!",
        "16": "Main batteries to the enemy ship dead center. Commencing assault! Sink away!",
        "18": "Night battle... Sounds good. Finally we, the Zaras will show what we're made of. All fleets, follow my lead. We're breaking through!",
        "17": "Battery number four, I'm counting on you. My tenaciousness is depending on this shot!",
        "23": "Eh? I'm number one? Grazie! I'll take the prize. Hehe...",
        "19": "Aahh! Why you...!",
        "20": "Noo! That hurts!",
        "21": "Kya! My plate won't fall off from just that!",

        "30": "Buona sera! Admiral, I'll be in charge of secretary duties today. Is that okay?",
        "31": "Um... Zero one... zero zero hours. Like that? That's how? Ufufu, good. Zero zero!",
        "32": "02..00 hours. Yes, it's the middle of the night. I hope Pola's not still out drinking... I'm a little worried.",
        "33": "0300 hours. Alright, I think I'm getting used to it. Admiral, aren't I doing it perfectly? Ehe~",
        "34": "0400 hours. It'll be morning soon. I'm a little tired, but... I'll keep going, Admiral!",

        "38": "0800 hours. Admiral, would you like another espresso? R-really? Okay, I'll bring it right out!",
        "39": "0900 hours. Okay, time to start making use of the fleet. First up are the expeditions... oh? You want to do something else? Roger!",
        "40": "1000 hours. Which practice exercise did you want? I kind of want to take a crack at those Takaaao-class! Admiral, is that alright? Ehe... roger.",
        "41": "1100 hours. Those Takaaao sisters surprised me. I took some hits, but... how do I say it... it wasn't that bad. I'll challenge them again any day!",
        "42": "1200 hours. What would you like for lunch? I learned to make a new sort of pasta--would you want to try it? Do you prefer rosso or bianco?",
        "43": "1300 hours. How was it? Since it has a strong flavor, it's best to drink some wine first. Oh! But don't drink too much.",
        "44": "14--Ah, Ciao, Libe! How are you? That's good to hear. I made a lot of new friends. Eh? I'll introduce you next time!",
