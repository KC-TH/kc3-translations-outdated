        "1": "I'm Repair ship Akashi. If you take a little damage, I can fix you up in the base. Just leave it to me!",
        "25": "I'm Akashi, the only dedicated repair ship in the combined fleet. I was in charge of repairing ships damaged in the front lines when I was stationed in the Truk Anchorage. I supported the fleet from behind right up until the destruction of the Anchorage. Pleased to meet you.",
        "2": "Looks like it's Akashi's turn.",
        "3": "Admiral, you need repairs? Have you been damaged somewhere?",
        "4": "It's dangerous, so don't touch my cranes... hey! That's even more dangerous!",
        "29": "Right... don't worry! I'm busy with things such as repairs and procuring new machinery! So don't worry! ... really...",
        "28": "Admiral... you've gotta make sure you fix yourself up sometimes. Just leave the maintenance... to me, okay?",
        "24": "Admiral, what is it? You want to process the ring in my factory? Geez... I wonder who the lucky person is? Ehh... for me?! No way...! I-I'll treasure it! Thank you!",
        "8": "Do you want to check the fleet's operational status, Admiral?",
        "13": "Repair ship Akashi, now departing!",
        "9": "Now...this is what I call progress!",
        "10": "Now I can repair even more! Thank you so much!",
        "26": "Should I repair this?",
        "27": "Thank you! This really helps!",
        "11": "I guess even I need maintenance once in a while...",
        "12": "Phew... what a blessing it is to have people washing my back. Thanks so much.",
        "6": "Arsenal's renovation is completed.",
        "5": "It seems like a new ship has been completed. Looking forward to it.",
        "7": "The fleet has returned safely. Phew.",

        "15": "Fighting isn't my... well... but I guess I'll just have to do it!",
        "16": "Hit!",
        "18": "A pursuit... w-what am I supposed to do about that?!",
        "17": "It's not my forte, but here we go...!",
        "23": "Eh...EEEEEH!? M-me!? How did that happen...? Well, can't say I'm not happy...",
        "19": "Geh... ouch... is my factory fine?",
        "20": "I'm hit...don't let the fire spread to the work machines!",
        "21": "I...I was targetted!? I can't do a good repair job in this state!",
        "22": "Seems like I'm heading towards the sea floor... guess I can have another long sleep. Good night.",
        "30": "0000, Midnight... Shouldn't you be resting soon?",
        "31": "0100. Aren't you sleepy after all? Eh? Me? I'm fine!",
        "32": "0200. I've somehow remembered my time at Truk... I sure worked hard.",
        "33": "0300. About Palau\u2026 I wonder why? I don't really remember much of it.",
        "34": "0400. It's morning soon, yeah? Admiral? You sure you're fine with not sleeping tonight?",
        "35": "0500. The sky is gradually getting brighter! It's a brand new day!",
        "36": "0600. Admiral? What will you have for breakfast? It's not anywhere near Mamiya's level, but my cooking is unexpectedly good, you know?",
        "37": "0700. It's morning, huh. Should we go and wake the sleepy heads up?",
        "38": "0800, huh. Now! Time to get the repairs on!",
        "39": "0900. Which ship would you like me to repair? \u2026Eh!? It can't be\u2026 a sortie!?",
        "40": "1000. \u2026Admiral? For me, battles are a bit\u2026 ah\u2026 no\u2026 even if you load me with all these weapons\u2026",
        "41": "1100. You're too reckless admiral. It'll be hell if the work machines broke down!",
        "42": "1200. It's afternoon! It's Akashi curry time! What do you say?!",
        "43": "1300. I'll be doing the inspection of ship interior factory! There's quite a lot of it~",
        "44": "1400. It's about time I dive fully into the afternoon repairs, okay?",
        "45": "1500. Admiral? Don't you feel a little hungry now? Hmm?",
        "46": "1600. Mamiya Monaka is really tasty, isn't it! I would like to make some in the ship too...",
        "47": "1700. The sun will be setting soon. Oof\u2026 It's been tiring, yeah.",
        "48": "1800. Do you want to eat out for dinner? Like the Yamato hotel, perhaps... just a joke, really.",
        "49": "1900. I'm sorry it's only something simple, but dinner is ready!",
        "50": "2000 I guess a full stomach really makes you sleepy, huh\u2026 Yaaawnn\u2026 Ah-- I shouldn't!",
        "51": "2100, huh. The day will be ending in three more hours. Thanks for the good work.",
        "52": "2200 Nights at the anchorage sure is quiet, huh\u2026 It'll be nice if it stays like this\u2026",
        "53": "2300 Admiral? Thank you for your hard work for today!"
