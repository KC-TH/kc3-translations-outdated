        "1": "Yes... I am Taihou. Thank you for your reception. Admiral... I shall bring victory to you and your task force!",
        "25": "I'm the Armoured Carrier, Taihou. I'm the newest and most advanced standard carrier that is armed with a flight deck. Aren't these enclosed hangars great? Hmm? You say that gas builds up easily? How rude. I-it'll be fine this time!",
        "2": "Admiral. Are you interested in my armoured flight deck?",
        "3": "Yes, these are the newest enclosed hangars. I can fit Ryuuseis and Reppus with no problem.",
        "4": "Are you really that interested in the colour of my flight deck? Your face is close... it's making me feel awkward.",
        "29": "Admiral! Making me wait... I won't say anymore. Training and planning are important. Shall we sortie once we are properly ready?",
        "28": "Admiral, aren't you tired? Really? Well, that's okay. But don\u2019t overdo it\u2026 okay?",
        "24": "Admiral.. Did I meet your expectations? Well, that's great\u266a But I've still got much more to go. Let's stay together and do our best!",
        "8": "Admiral! A report for you.",
        "13": "Today's winds are good... Standard Carrier Taihou, heading out!",
        "9": "Hmm... not bad.",
        "10": "This is great! Much appreciated.",
        "26": "A nice wind.",
        "27": "With proper supplies and training, they won't call us turkeys!",
        "11": "You're right. A small wound may end up a fatal one.",
        "12": "It's important to use this time to carry out some proper repairs.",
        "6": "That was a perfect repair!",
        "5": "Construction of a new ship has been completed!",
        "7": "Campaign complete! The fleet has returned to base.",
        "14": "Everyone ready? We're going out. First mobile squadron, sortieing!",
        "15": "I'll show you the true strength of the newest and most advanced armoured carrier!",
        "16": "My brilliant pilots will show you what they're made of!",
        "18": "Yes. We shall use this opportunity to annihilate them!",
        "23": "Admiral, did I not promise you victory? I won't lose!",
        "19": "This level of damage would not faze me!",
        "20": "Hah! E-explosion?! My Tankers? Are they all right?!",
        "21": "Argh! M-my fuel! Gotta make sure it doesn't ignite!",
        "22": "I'm sinking... again. However, you saw me going wild, didn't you? Good... I'm... satisfied.",
        "30": "Midnight. I, Taihou shall be the one telling you the time today.",
        "31": "0100. Hmm? You want to train together? Sure.",
        "32": "0200. Even if I'm the newest and most advanced, I'll feel insecure if you keep looking at me like that!",
        "33": "0300. Admiral, shouldn't you take some sleep? Eh, you'll be fine?",
        "34": "040...0... Haa... Fuu... Ah, I- I'm not sleeping! Really!",
        "35": "0500. It's morning. Shall we start with some running? Eh, Dailies?",
        "36": "0600. Admiral, what would you like for breakfast? A Japanese meal from Mamiya?",
        "37": "0700. Stamina training is the most basic of basics. Some press ups before breakfast would go well.",
        "38": "0800. The breakfast was delicious! Now for some more muscle training!",
        "39": "0900. Admiral, why are you looking so tired before we have even started combat? Are you okay?",
        "40": "1000. Now, it's time to really start the fighting!",
        "41": "1100. That feels nice! Admiral, are you still holding up?",
        "42": "1200. It's noon. I wonder what sort of curry is served in this fleet.",
        "43": "It's 1300. Eh?! It's my turn to make curry, as I'm the secretary this time?!",
        "44": "1400. Sorry, this ended up really late... but here's some Taihou curry.",
        "45": "1500. How was my curry? It was great...? Hurray!",
        "46": "1600. Most accidents occur in the evening. Let's stay vigilant!",
        "47": "It's 1700. Eh?! An explosion from far away...? That's scary... be careful of fires!",
        "48": "1800. Um... my apologies... triggered explosions are the only thing I can't handle... enemies are fine.",
        "49": "1900. Admiral, as you're here... I've calmed down. It's true.",
        "50": "2000. That suisei? Yes, I would never forget it.",
        "51": "2100. This late already? Time seems to fly by when I'm with you. It's amazing.",
        "52": "2200. Admiral, you're done for the day, aren't you? How about some alcohol with the late night snack?",
        "53": "2300. If you drink too much... Oh? Hehe... your sleeping face is adorable. D'ohoh."
