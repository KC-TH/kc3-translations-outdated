        "1": "I'm the fourth battleship of the Vittorio Veneto-class, Roma. Nice to meet you. What? Please don't stare at me, okay?",
        "25": "The Italian-made, state of the art warship. Fourth of the Vittorio Veneto class battleships, Roma. Yes, I was together with my elder sister at that time. The day those monsters were dropped. I won't forget that pain. I absolutely won't forget it.",
        "2": "Buon giorno. Did you call for Roma?",
        "3": "Admiral, do you have an order for Roma? Oh, then that's fine.",
        "4": "What's that Admiral?\u3000The way you touch the left area around my deck is unforgivable. Can I give you the counterattack?",
        "29": "Damn that bomber... you better remember this! Ah, Admiral? What? I didn't say anything. None at all. Aren't you just hearing things? Come on, work first work first.",
        "28": "What, admiral? You seems free. How about becoming my partner then? Ah, of course that's not what I meant. We're just talking a walk over there, a walk. Let's go.",
        "24": "What? Even though I look like this, I'm actually busy. What's that box? 'Try to open it'? I'll do it later then. Wha? In this place? But now is...",
        "8": "Confirming the information? Well that's important.",
        "13": "Battleship Roma, sortieing. I'm going first, sister.",
        "9": "Japanese improvement... Well that's good too, thanks.",
        "10": "Grazie. With this... maybe I will become better with this.",
        "26": "That's decent",
        "27": "Grazie. I'm gonna go again, you can count on me.",
        "11": "I'm going to need a little repair. What? Don't stare at me.",
        "12": "\u3000Um, for me to be at the dock... well that's fine... Tsk, I already said to not stare at me!",
        "5": "Admiral, looks like a new ship is ready to join the battle line.",
        "7": "The fleet has returned. What is it? Please, don't stare at me too much.",
        "14": "Roma of the Vittorio Veneto-class, starting! I'm serious, follow me!",
        "15": "Enemy fleet sighted! Commencing artillery fire. Here we go... Open all the gunports!",
        "16": "Commencing attack! Main artillery, fire!",
        "18": "This is a night battle? Well that's fine, I'll give it a try. Roma, charging forward!",
        "17": "Alright! We'll point our cannons directly to the enemy ships. Fire, Fire!",
        "23": "Ah!? It's me... Uhm... Is it me again? Well, whatever. I do feel happy though.",
        "19": "Tsk... that hurt.\u3000I'll remember this.",
        "20": "Iya... t-that place is... that's not bad, I'll show you this time!",
        "21": "Direct hit!? Am I done for? W-Well, I'm still fine. I won't sink this time!",
        "22": "Wa...N-no way... I'm sinking, again? That's ridiculous... No... Nee-san...",
        "30": "The date has changed, Admiral. I, Roma, will be your secretary of the day. What? Do you object?",
        "31": "01...0...0... I'm still not used to this style yet. I did it correctly, right? Right?",
        "32": "02...0...0... Zero-Two... Zero... Zero... Yes, perfect. I got it down.",
        "33": "03...0...0... It's already three o'clock... Are you not getting sleepy, Admiral?",
        "34": "04...0...0... Isn't it already morning? As expected, keeping at it everyday seems bad for the skin.",
        "35": "05...0...0... I'm going to wake everyone up, okay? Admiral... you are sleepy now?",
        "36": "06...0...0... Well then, what should we do about breakfast? Is yesterday's bread fine with you?",
        "37": "07...0...0... Admiral. You looked sleepy so I made some cappuccino. Do you need another?",
        "38": "08...0...0... Well then, let's get to work. Let's send out the fleet. To the West? South?",
        "39": "09...0...0... So that's the Japanese Fast Battleship Kirishima? Hmmm...",
        "40": "10...0...0... Eh, with Kirishima? I see. I do feel like trying to go up against her at least once as well.",
        "41": "11...0...0... It's already noon... Time flies. What do you want to do for lunch? Mamiya's, perhaps?",
        "42": "12...0...0... Japanese lunch is pretty simple, isn't it? I wonder if it can last till nighttime.",
        "43": "13...0...0... That dish called katsu curry surprise me a little. Is it a type of risotto? Unique, isn't it? It's powerful.",
        "44": "14...0...0... Bismarck? Yes, I do know her, albeit only the name. She's famous, you know.",
        "45": "15...0...0... Ah, Kirishima? What is it? Did you need me for something? Ah, my glasses?",
        "46": "16...0...0... I got a little nervous. Kirishima... doesn't seem like a bad person, right?",
        "47": "17...0...0... The sun is setting. I'm worn out today too. How about you, Admiral? Is that so?",
        "48": "18...0...0... Admiral, what do you want to do for dinner? Eh, Kongou? Kirishima? What's happening?!",
        "49": "19...0...0... What is the \"Fast Battleship Union?\" Wha- whaaa--?! Me too? Whaaa?!",
        "50": "20...0...0... This white wine known as \"Nihonshu\"... is good! You drinking, Admiral?",
        "51": "21... Phew... They finally went back. Do Japanese battleships not have any sense of shame?",
        "52": "22...0...0... Ah, sis. It's fine, I'm doing the job properly. Don't worry.",
        "53": "23...0...0... Eh? I reek of alcohol? I... it's the fault of Kirishima and the rest!"
